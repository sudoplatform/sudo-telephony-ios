// Push handler is a bridge for us between the push notification payload, the call provider (Twilio), and the sdk user.
// It receives a push payload and attempts to handle it.
//
// It lets us know about some events, e.g the push payload was turned into a call invite, or if the call was canceled.
// When this happens we notify the user of the new incoming call, or if the call was canceled.  We also notify callkit of these events.
// When we let the user know about the incoming call we give them the ability to set the display name and the delegate for the call related
// events (active call delegate).  If the call is answered we know where to send events.
//
// When we need to get info back from the SDK user, e.g. decline call or answer call, the push handler will also tell us about these events.
// When a call is answered, The IncomingCall will tell the push handler about the event.

// The push handler has access to the underlying types, e.g. CallInvite (the Twilio call will have it and could pass it back if need be).
// That makes it the appropriate place to create the `VendorCall`.  Of course `VendorCall` has some closures that need to be passed in, so we'll pass
// those into the push handler.  That way when a call is answered the push handler has the closures and data needed to init a `VendorCall`.
// The push handler will then notify us that the call was answered so we can report it to callKit.
